Version: 1.2
Date: 2020-12-07
Author: Aeryan Eftekhari
Description: SQUIC tackles the statistical problem of estimating large sparse 
inverse covariance matrices. This estimation poses an ubiquitous 
problem that arises in many applications e.g. coming from the 
fields mathematical finance, geology and health. 
SQUIC belongs to the class of second-order L1-regularized 
Gaussian maximum likelihood methods and is especially suitable 
for high-dimensional datasets with limited number of samples.
